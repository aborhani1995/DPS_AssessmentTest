# DPS_AssessmentTest (Task 1)
This repository provides my solution for Task1 and Task2 of the DPS Assessment Test.
## Demonstrations

The project structure is as follow:

/
./AssessmentTesWF 
./Specific_to_Task1
./Specific_to_Task2

AssessmentTesWF foler:
Here you are able to see the workflows for Task1 and Task2. This folder can be easily opened up by the Apollo editor. There, you will find two workflow solutions Task1 and Task2. You are able to either use the editor in order to view the yml file or open up the Task1.yml file from 'Specific_to_Task1' directory.)

## Prerequisites
No more Prerequisites are necessary.

## Running the Demo.

1. Clone the repository (either Specific_to_Task1/Task1 or Specific_to_Task2/Task2).

2. Using the terminal, switch to the directory containing the `build.gradle` file and run `sudo ./gradlew build eclipse` to automatically download the dependencies and build the project.

3. Open up the eclipse and import the project in it. all necessary files including launch file, xml files, input file and so on are provided. So, just go ahead and run the launch file. 

4. The only thing is that you should have access to the docker so that the application can download docker images. Furthermore, I normally run the eclipse application as sudo to prevent any inaccessibility to files.


## Other files:
Except 'Task1' and 'Task2' subfolder which are indeed the main executable application of each task, you may find a few more files for each projects (i.e 'Specific_to_Task1' or 'Specific_to_Task1' subfolders). For instance the 'Execution_snapshot' will provide you with a few snapshot of the successful execution of the code on my machine. 'Schematic_diagram/' contains the visio file of the schematic diagram of workflow for each Task. The "typeMappings.json" file can be seen in "FunctionTemplate/openfaas" folder. Moreover, the important "functions.py" and "Task.yml files are placed in these folders."
